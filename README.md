#Python Operators
#In Python programming, Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables.
#These are standard symbols used for logical and arithmetic operations.
#OPERATORS: These are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, **, % .
#OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied.

#Arithmetic Operators in Python
#Python Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#Precedence of Arithmetic Operators in Python
#The precedence of Arithmetic Operators in Python is as follows:

#1.E – Exponentiation(**)

#2.M – Multiplication(‘*’) (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)

#3.D – Division

#4.A – Addition(‘+’) (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)

#5.S – Subtraction(‘-‘)

#6.The modulus of Python operators (‘%’) helps us extract the last digit/s of a number.
